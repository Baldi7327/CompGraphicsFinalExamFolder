A Shader for the water was created that used a combination of the wave
effect, as well as scrollling texture effect, in order to create a more
accurate water look to match the bottom of the provided image for the 
scene. 

The flat and toon shaders from earlier in the course were also implemented
in order to attempt to match the old style look and colours of the 
original game. This was chosen as the less smooth style of the shaders
creates a similar look to that of old style pixelated graphics. 

The Stencil Shader was also added with the purpose of being able to hide 
the enemy from view when the stencil is in front of them as opposed to
making them visible when the Stencil is in front of them as usual.
